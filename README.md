Following the attacks on 9/11, many countries throughout the world looked to shore up Internet regulation in order to thwart future attacks (Watney 2007). Rich, analytical summations of different legal, ethical, or policy-based discussions of efforts to counter terrorism through various regulatory means (e.g., West 2021). One strand of such work follows the evolution of cybersecurity capacity building (CCB), whereby scholars such as Pawlak and Barmpaliou (2016) have commented on the uneven pace at which states have fortified their own CCB. These works allude to a couple limitations in the extant counter-terrorism literature vis-à-vis online-based tools. First, much of the work has yet to systematically analyze variations in governments’ ability to strengthen their ability to monitor or regulate the Internet. Second, authors have noted that considerable variation exists as far as CCB throughout the world. Given the increasing reliance on the Internet and social media platforms by terrorist groups, additional investigation is needed to uncover to what extent lax online regulation plays in terrorist activity. To address this puzzle, we analyze data over a 20-year period for roughly 100 democratic and authoritarian states using V-dem and Digital Society Project data. The results of numerous analyses underscore the link between weak government regulation and terrorist activity.
